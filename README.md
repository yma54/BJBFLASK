# VTM Tank Painting Price Estimate Practice Project
> In this project I created a three-page website for a company to estimate paint job prices.
  The website contains the homepage, about page, and estimate page. Users can put in the radius and height of the tank they want to estimate for the paint job, and gets an estimate cost.

## General Information
- The purpose of the project is to practice creating multiple pages, creating links to each other, and practice using Python files for calculation and tests.
- Created three html pages.
- Created the 'app.py' file to write functions of going to other pages, get/post, and calculations. 
- After the pages were created, I also added tests files using Pytest(Files under 'test' folder)
- Created App service in Microsoft Azure, updated the pipeline files to run through all the tests.URL:https://vtmtankflask.azurewebsites.net

## Technologies Used
- VisualStudioCode
- HTML
- Python
- GitHub Desktop 



## Room for Improvement
The purpose was to practice using Python functions along with html codes, so the project does not have too many functions or tests.
Room for improvement:
- Better layout and styling for the pages.
- Could add more advanced Pytest functions.

To do:
- Add more to the stylesheet
- Add more functions,tests



## Acknowledgements
